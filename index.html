            Hello! Welcome to my website and thank you for downloading my app!</p> 
        <p>So what’s this app for?</p>
            <p>Box 2D Beat! Can be used by amateurs and pros alike; amateurs can use it like a group exercise class when there isn’t one available, and pros can use it to develop speed, power and stamina. It does this by forcing you to keep to a tempo; if you try to go fast on the pads or on a bag etc. without this app, you will unknowingly slow down as you go: with this app, you will know at which point you start to slack, enabling you to monitor it and thus be able to push through that point little by little as you get better with that session. Once you get through that session without flaking, you move onto the next one. Don’t believe me? Try it for one month and then come back to the bag. See how your speed, power and stamina have improved! </p>
          <p>What’s the best way to use this app? </p>
          <p>Find a session that you can’t quite make it all the way through and keep coming back, throwing it at the beginning of your session (after warming up), and when you’re able to do that one with ease, move on to the next one! Or you can keep on that one and bring the power up! If you want to work on power, do a slow One to Eight! and hit every punch with everything you’ve got! If you want to see where I’m at, check the video above; as you’ll see, I start flaking just as it comes to an end. But I will be back!</p>
        <p>If you want to post your session on your social media, just email me in the first instance then record your session but with the music on a speaker so I can hear it. When you send the video to me, I will overdub the actual music and shabam! you have a video!</p>
